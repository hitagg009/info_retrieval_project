      "        The success of neural network methods for computing word embeddings has motivated methods for generating semantic embeddings of longer pieces of text, such as sentences and paragraphs. Surprisingly, Wieting et al (ICLR'16) showed that such complicated methods are outperformed, especially in out-of-domain (transfer learning) settings, by simpler methods involving mild retraining of word embeddings and basic linear regression. The  method of Wieting et al. requires retraining with a substantial labeled dataset such as Paraphrase Database (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013). \n",

      "        The current paper goes further, showing that the following completely unsupervised sentence embedding is a formidable baseline: Use word embeddings computed using one of the popular methods on unlabeled corpus like Wikipedia, represent the sentence by a weighted average of the word vectors, and then modify them a bit using PCA/SVD. This weighting improves performance by about 10% to 30% in textual similarity tasks, and beats sophisticated supervised methods including RNN's and LSTM's. It even improves Wieting et al.'s embeddings. \n",

      "We consider the two related problems of detecting if an example is misclassified or out-of-distribution. We present a simple baseline that utilizes probabilities from softmax distributions. Correctly classified examples tend to have greater maximum softmax probabilities than erroneously classified and out-of-distribution examples, allowing for their detection. We assess performance by defining several tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and automatic speech recognition, showing the effectiveness of this baseline across all. We then show the baseline can sometimes be surpassed, demonstrating the room for future research on these underexplored detection tasks.\n",

      "In this work, we investigate a novel training procedure to learn a generative model as the transition operator of a Markov chain, such that, when applied repeatedly on an unstructured random noise sample, it will denoise it into a sample that matches the target distribution from the training set. The novel training procedure to learn this progressive denoising operation involves sampling from a slightly different chain than the model chain used for generation in the absence of a denoising target. In the training chain we infuse information from the training target example that we would like the chains to reach with a high probability. The thus learned transition operator is able to produce quality and varied samples in a small number of steps. Experiments show competitive results compared to the samples generated with a basic Generative Adversarial Net. \n",

      "Sample complexity and safety are major challenges when learning policies with reinforcement learning for real-world tasks, especially when the policies are represented using rich function approximators like deep neural networks. Model-based methods where the real-world target domain is approximated using a simulated source domain provide an avenue to tackle the above challenges by augmenting real data with simulated data. However, discrepancies between the simulated source domain and the target domain pose a challenge for simulated training. We introduce the EPOpt algorithm, which uses an ensemble of simulated source domains and a form of adversarial training to learn policies that are robust and generalize to a broad range of possible target domains, including to unmodeled effects. Further, the probability distribution over source domains in the ensemble can be adapted using data from the target domain and approximate Bayesian methods, to progressively make it a better approximation. Thus, learning on a model ensemble, along with source domain adaptation, provides the benefit of both robustness and learning.\n",

      "We quantify a source of ineffectual computations when processing the multiplications of the convolutional layers in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and propose Pragmatic (PRA), an architecture that exploits it improving performance and energy efficiency. \n",
      "        The source of these ineffectual computations is best understood in the context of conventional multipliers which generate internally multiple terms, that is, products of the multiplicand and powers of two, which added together produce the final product. At runtime, many of these terms are zero as they are generated when the multiplicand is combined with the zero-bits of the multiplicator. While conventional bit-parallel multipliers calculate all terms in parallel to reduce individual product latency, Pragmatic calculates only the non-zero terms resulting in a design whose execution time for convolutional layers is ideally proportional to the number of activation bits that are 1. Measurements demonstrate that for the convolutional layers on Convolutional Neural Networks and during inference, Pragmatic improves performance by 4.3x over the DaDiaNao (DaDN) accelerator and by 4.5x when DaDN uses an 8-bit quantized representation. DaDiannao was reported to be 300x faster than commodity graphics processors. \n",

      "Sum-product networks (SPNs) have recently emerged as an attractive representation due to their dual view as a special type of deep neural network with clear semantics and a special type of probabilistic graphical model for which inference is always tractable. Those properties follow from some conditions (i.e., completeness and decomposability) that must be respected by the structure of the network.  As a result, it is not easy to specify a valid sum-product network by hand and therefore structure learning techniques are typically used in practice.  This paper describes the first online structure learning technique for continuous SPNs with Gaussian leaves. We also introduce an accompanying new parameter learning technique.\n",

      "We present Deep Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (DGCCA) â€“ a method for learning nonlinear transformations of arbitrarily many views of data, such that the resulting transformations are maximally informative of each other. While methods for nonlinear two-view representation learning (Deep CCA, (Andrew et al., 2013)) and linear many-view representation learning (Generalized CCA (Horst, 1961)) exist, DGCCA is the first CCA-style multiview representation learning technique that combines the flexibility of nonlinear (deep) representation learning with the statistical power of incorporating information from many independent sources, or views. We present the DGCCA formulation as well as an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm for solving it. We learn DGCCA representations on two distinct datasets for three downstream tasks: phonetic transcription from acoustic and articulatory measurements, and recommending hashtags and friends on a dataset of Twitter users. We find that DGCCA representations soundly beat existing methods at phonetic transcription and hashtag recommendation, and in general perform no worse than standard linear many-view techniques.\n",

      "In this paper, we study deep generative models for effective unsupervised learning. We propose VGAN, which works by minimizing a variational lower bound of the negative log likelihood (NLL) of an energy based model (EBM), where the model density $p(\\mathbf{x})$ is approximated by a variational distribution $q(\\mathbf{x})$ that is easy to sample from. The training of VGAN takes a two step procedure: given $p(\\mathbf{x})$, $q(\\mathbf{x})$ is updated to maximize the lower bound; $p(\\mathbf{x})$ is then updated one step with samples drawn from $q(\\mathbf{x})$ to decrease the lower bound. VGAN is inspired by the generative adversarial networks (GANs), where $p(\\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the discriminator and $q(\\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the generator, but with several notable differences. We hence name our model variational GANs (VGANs). VGAN provides a practical solution to training deep EBMs in high dimensional space, by eliminating the need of MCMC sampling. From this view, we are also able to identify causes to the difficulty of training GANs and propose viable solutions.\n",

      "Finding relationships between multiple views of data is essential both in exploratory analysis and as pre-processing for predictive tasks. A prominent approach is to apply variants of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), a classical method seeking correlated components between views. The basic CCA is restricted to maximizing a simple dependency criterion, correlation, measured directly between data coordinates. We introduce a new method that finds dependent subspaces of views directly optimized for the data analysis task of neighbor retrieval between multiple views. We optimize mappings for each view such as linear transformations to maximize cross-view similarity between neighborhoods of data samples. The criterion arises directly from the well-defined retrieval task, detects nonlinear and local similarities, measures dependency of data relationships rather than only individual data coordinates, and is related to well understood measures of information retrieval quality. In experiments the proposed method outperforms alternatives in preserving cross-view neighborhood similarities, and yields insights into local dependencies between multiple views.\n",
